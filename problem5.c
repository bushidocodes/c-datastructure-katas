// Write an algorithm that takes a binary tree T(at most N nodes) as an input and computes the number of
// nodes at each depth. The algorithm should store the output in an array D[0:N-1], where your algorithm
// should store the number of nodes at depth k in D[k]

// Input is a binary tree
// Output is an array indexed by level with a value equal to the number of nodes at that level
